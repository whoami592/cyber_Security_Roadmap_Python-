Cybersecurity Roadmap — 2025

For: Mr. Sabaz Ali Khan — Pakistani White-Hat Hacker

Nice — let’s make a practical, hands-on roadmap that turns you into a respected, legal, and effective white-hat security pro in 2025. I’ll give a 24-month plan broken into phases, weekly routines, study resources, certifications, tools, project ideas for a portfolio, career paths, and ethical/legal reminders tailored for Pakistan.

Quick overview (what you’ll achieve)

Core skills: Linux, networking, scripting (Python + Bash), web & network pentesting, Windows internals.

Certs & credibility: CompTIA Security+/Network+ (optional), CEH (intro), OSCP (pro), plus specialized certs later.

Portfolio: 8–12 public projects (writeups, CTFs, bug bounties, labs).

Goal roles: Junior pentester → Red team / Security engineer → Bug bounty / consultant.

Ethics & Legal foundation (read first)

Always get explicit written permission (scope, duration, targets).

Follow Pakistani laws — avoid scanning/attacking external targets without authorization. Use lab environments, CTFs, and responsible disclosure practices for real bugs.

Join white-hat groups, sign NDAs when required, and practice full disclosure responsibly.

Phase 0 — Preparation (Weeks 0–2)

Set up your workstation: Linux VM (Kali/Parrot) + host Windows VM for testing. Use VirtualBox/VMware.

Create accounts: GitHub (portfolio), LinkedIn (professional), HackerOne/Bugcrowd (for bug bounties), TryHackMe / HackTheBox.

Daily goal: 1 hour reading basics + 1 hour hands-on.

Phase 1 — Foundations (Months 1–3)

Skills to build

Linux basics: file system, permissions, package managers, bash.

Networking: TCP/IP, ports, subnets, DNS, HTTP basics.

Scripting: Python fundamentals, network scripting (sockets, requests), Bash scripting.

Security basics: CIA triad, threat models, authentication, cryptography basics.

Weekly plan

8–12 hours/week. 3 theory hours + 5–9 hands-on lab hours.

Deliverables

Small GitHub repo: bash scripts + Python scripts (port scanner, simple web scraper).

Complete 5 beginner rooms on TryHackMe / HTB Academy.

Phase 2 — Web & Network Pentesting (Months 4–8)

Skills to build

Web: OWASP Top 10, SQLi, XSS, CSRF, file upload, auth bypass.

Network: Nmap, Netcat, SMB, SNMP, basic exploitation, routing.

Tools: Nmap, Burp Suite (Community), Nikto, DirBuster, Wireshark, Metasploit basics.

Weekly plan

12–16 hours/week: structured labs + one mini project.

Projects

Full writeup: find & document 3 web app vulns in lab VM (recon → exploit → remediation).

Network pentest report template (recon, findings, PoC, remediation).

Milestones

Publish 3 vulnerability writeups on GitHub or personal blog (sanitized, no live target names).

Phase 3 — Exploitation & Red Team Basics (Months 9–12)

Skills

Buffer overflows basics, privilege escalation (Linux/Windows), Windows internals, persistence.

Adversary emulation: basic post-exploitation (meterpreter, C2 concepts).

Build custom payloads and post-exploitation scripts safely in lab.

Tools & learning

Metasploit, BloodHound, PowerShell Empire concepts (legal lab use), Sysinternals.

Deliverables

2 in-depth privilege escalation writeups (Linux & Windows).

One red-team style lab: initial access → persistence → data exfiltration (in your lab).

Phase 4 — Advanced / Certification Prep (Months 13–18)

Certifications to target

CEH (optional: theoretical) — useful for resume.

OSCP (highly recommended) — practical pentesting cert with hands-on exam.

Consider OSWP / eJPT as stepping stones.

Study strategy

Daily labs, timed practice. Focus on methodology, reporting, and scripting PoCs.

Build a professional pentest report template with executive summary and technical appendix.

Deliverables

Pass OSCP (or complete its course labs).

Publish 6–8 polished writeups & reports.

Phase 5 — Specialization & Career Growth (Months 19–24)

Options

Red Team / Adversary Emulation — advanced offensive TTPs.

Application Security — secure code review, SAST/DAST tools.

Cloud Security — AWS/GCP/Azure secure architecture & pentesting.

IoT/Embedded — firmware reversing.

Business & community

Start doing bug bounties on HackerOne/Bugcrowd (authorized scopes).

Mentor juniors, speak at local meetups or YouTube channel (you mentioned videos earlier).

Deliverables

1–2 real bug bounty valid reports (in scope).

Public blog or YouTube series: 10 videos/writeups explaining pentest techniques (sanitized).

Tools & Tech Stack (start using early)

OS: Kali Linux (VM), Windows 10/11 VM.

Recon: Nmap, Masscan, Amass, Sublist3r.

Web: Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, sqlmap, wfuzz, DirBuster.

Network/Exploit: Wireshark, Metasploit, Netcat, Responder.

Post-exploitation: Mimikatz (lab), PowerSploit (lab).

Dev / Scripts: Python (requests, bs4, pwntools later), Bash.

Source control: Git/GitHub.

Learning platforms: TryHackMe, Hack The Box, PortSwigger Web Academy, VulnHub.
(Use legal labs and CTFs only.)

Weekly habit blueprint (repeatable)

Mon: 1–2 hours reading (articles, OWASP), 1 hour scripting.

Tue: 2–3 hours hands-on (web labs).

Wed: 1–2 hours networking labs + Wireshark practice.

Thu: 2–3 hours exploit/privesc practice.

Fri: 1 hour writeup/documentation (improve GitHub).

Weekend: 4–8 hours deep lab or CTF; submit bug bounties.

Portfolio — what to show employers/clients

GitHub projects: scripts, automation tools you wrote.

Writeups: step-by-step CTF/vuln reports (redacted).

Pentest report template: filled demo report against lab.

Certs & badges: displayed on LinkedIn.

YouTube/Blog: explainers (ethical, no full exploit disclosure against live systems).

Bug bounty Hall of Fame: if you start getting valid reports.

Job / Freelance path (how to apply this)

Start as Junior Security Analyst / SOC or Junior Pentester (contract or remote).

Offer freelance vulnerability assessments for small Pakistani companies (with legal contracts).

Network: Pakistani infosec Telegram/Discord groups, local meetups, conferences. Share public, useful posts to build reputation.

Quick 6-, 12-, 24-month milestones

6 months: Solid foundations, 5+ writeups, active on TryHackMe/HTB, basic tools fluency.

12 months: OSCP prep started/completed, 8–12 polished writeups, Linux/Windows privesc mastered.

24 months: OSCP (or equivalent), initial bug bounty payouts or consultancy projects, public presence (blog/YouTube), ready for senior roles.

Project & CTF ideas (start these now)

Build an introduction to recon script that chains subdomain enumeration → port scan → screenshot service.

Host a vulnerable web app (DVWA, Juice Shop) and document 5 OWASP vulns with fixes.

Capture the Flag solves with full writeups (web + pwn).

Local outreach: offer a free security awareness session for a small business — document the engagement.

Resume / LinkedIn quick tips

Focus on achievements: “Found X validated vulnerabilities (OWASP) in lab environments; produced full remediation reports.”

List tools and languages concisely.

Add GitHub link and 1–2 highlight writeups.

Mention Open-source contributions or videos.

Final notes & personalised encouragement

Sabaz — you already have the right focus. Prioritize hands-on practice, clear documentation, and legal/ethical behavior. Keep a learning log (short daily notes) and every month publish one polished writeup. That public record will make you stand out in Pakistan’s growing cybersec scene.
